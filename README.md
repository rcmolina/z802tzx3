# z802tzx3 
Modified z802tzx with new speeds for maxduino


* Now using ID11 so pilot length can be tuned 
* You can change game_name and info colours (ink, paper,brigh) (@Merlinkv)
* Also possible 2 game_name lines -g1 -g2
* 300 .z80 image files with MC binary compressed inside with zx7b and decompressed when loaded. Using z802tzx3 you can get effective loading time of the converted .tzx file of 1/6. If needed use again z802tzx3 to get a lower turbo conversion speed for maxduino on the real equipment.
